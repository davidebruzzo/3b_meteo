## Introduction

This readme contains the description of the main components of the project.

The aim of the simulation is to replicate a police patrolling drone operating in narrow streets, in particular Genoa Historical Center. 

Down below you can find specific and detailed description of the code we developed to obtain the behaviour of the patrolling drone, randomic crowd walking and suspicious criminal behaviour, as well as few lines on the environment we built. 

	
## Environment

To recreate the narrow streets typical of Genoa Center we used different 3d models for buildings, pubs, church and the floor. The first map that is showed when you launch the simulation is built on the combination of these 3d assets.
Here the list of the folder that contain parts of the environment:
* [bench_AND_fence](https://unigeit.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/VRxRobot2223-Group3BMeteo/Documenti%20condivisi/Group%203BMeteo/MyProject/Content/3b_meteo/bench_AND_fence?csf=1&web=1&e=EFo7UT): Model of the bench and fence that are used into playground. The fence in particular is placed also along the path for the church.
* [fountain](https://unigeit.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/VRxRobot2223-Group3BMeteo/Documenti%20condivisi/Group%203BMeteo/MyProject/Content/3b_meteo/fountain?csf=1&web=1&e=u6gfKg): Model of the fountain placed in the middle of the square.
